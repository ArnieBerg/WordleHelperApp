# WordleHelper

## Description
You're playing Wordle but not scoring as well as your friends?  Here is a little WordleHelper for you.  

Turning on HELP MODE allows you to get an edge on the online version of Wordle (I know, it takes the 
challenge out of it). In HELP MODE, you enter the word you guessed in the official version of Wordle 
and indicate the color clues that Wordle reported. 

Take your last guess in Wordle and type it into WordleHelper but do it ONE LETTER AT A TIME.  Type in 
the first letter and then press the Enter Key or Space Bar to cycle through the various color choices 
(gray, yellow and green).  When you come to the color of the letter as it was displayed in the official 
Wordle site, press the Tab key to move to the next letter.  Do this until you have entered each of the 
5 letters.  Now press the 'Guess!' button and WordleHelper will display all the 5-letter words still in 
the running.  Use that list to choose your next guess to take back to the official Wordle game.  

Alternatively, and more simply, select the best guess from the list of eligible words and click on the 
Best Guess command button to have that word entered for you. Also enter that guess on the official Wordle 
site and make your color selections match with what is on the official Wordle site for that word, then 
click on ‘Guess!’ to narrow down the remaining eligible words.

Together, we'll solve this thing every time!
